
external files:
  When executing the project as an application, the external files (in specific: the data-folder with its content) has to be located in the working directory
  (equal to "System.getProperty("user.dir")"; meant is the same directory in which the .jar-file is located), e.g.:

    bomberman
    |
    +-data
    | |
    | +-maps
    | | |
    | | +-...
    | +-sounds
    | | |
    | | +-...
    | |
    | +-sprites
    |   |
    |   +-...
    |
    +-bomberman.jar

  When executing the project as an applet, the external files has to be located in the parent directory, e.g.:

    bomberman
    |
    +-data
    | |
    | +-maps
    | | |
    | | +-...
    | +-sounds
    | | |
    | | +-...
    | |
    | +-sprites
    |   |
    |   +-...
    |
    +-bin
      |
      +-bomberman.html
      |
      +-bomberman.jar

  The size of the applet can be changed in the run configuration when executing it with eclipse.
